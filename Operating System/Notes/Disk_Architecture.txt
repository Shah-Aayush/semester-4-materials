HARD DISK ARCHITECTURE
	Platters -> Surface -> Track -> Sector -> Data
	Disk size = Platters * 2 * Surface * Track * Sector * Data	[each platter has by default 2 surface/heads]
	No of bites required to represent disk size = Log2(Disk size)
	
	1K = 2^10
	1M = 2^20
	1G = 2^30
	1T = 2^40

Each platter has by default two heads/surface.
Spindel is used to move disk in clock wise/anti click wise direction.

DISK ACCESS TIME 
	Seek time : Time taken by R/W head to reach desired track.
	Rotation time :  Time taken for one full rotation (360)
	Rotational Latency : Time taken to reach to desired sector. (half of rotation time)
	Transfer Time : Data to be transfer/ Transfer rate;
	Transfer rate (Data rate) :  No. of heads(or surface) * Capacity of one track(data size in track) * No. of Rotations in one second (if given in RPM then convert it in RPS by dividing the 60 by RPM : 3000 RPM ~ 60/3000 RPS)
	
	Disk access time : Seek time + Rotational Latency + Transfer time + Controller time (if given) + Queue time (if given)
	If any one is not given then you can consider it as ZERO.
