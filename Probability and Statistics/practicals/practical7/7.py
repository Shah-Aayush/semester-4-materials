#Scan an integer n from the user. Scan n sentences (no special character, punctuation, all lower case letters). Each sentenceâ€™s sentiment is either positive or negative. Scan 2 different words y and z from the user. y and z should be words from the set of distinct words constructed from n sentences. Write a program to estimate (i) the probability of y being present in the positive sentences (ii) the joint probability of y and z being present in positive sentences assuming that the presence of y and z in any sentence are independent events. What would be this probability if these events are not independent?
