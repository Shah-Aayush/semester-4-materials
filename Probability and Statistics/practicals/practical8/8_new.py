# Scan an integer n from the user. Scan n sentences (no special character, punctuation, all lower case letters). Each sentenceâ€™s sentiment is either positive or negative. Scan 5 words- a, b, c, d and e from the user. a, b, c, d, and e should be words from the set of distinct words constructed from n sentences. a, b, c, d, and e need not to be distinct words. Write a program to estimate (i) the joint probability of sampling a, b, c, d, and e from positive sentences. Assume that events of sampling a word are independent and the probability of sampling any word remains constant over different trials of sampling events.
