Multiple regression
-
it is nothing but an extension of simple linear regression.but instead of 1 
independent variable we have more that one independent variable and we try to fit a linear equation using observed data


Linear regression
-
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by 
fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable,
and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.


Correlation
-
The degree of relationship between the variables under
consideration is measure through the correlation analysis.
When the y variable tends to increase as the x variable increases, 
we say there is a positive correlation between the variables. 
When the y variable tends to decrease as the x variable increases, 
we say there is a negative correlation between the variables


Conditional probability 
-
conditional probability is defined as the likelihood[-chance/probability] of an event or outcome occurring, 
based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome.



the Bayes’ theorem
-
the Bayes’ theorem is used to determine the conditional probability of events. 
Essentially, the Bayes’ theorem describes the probability of an event based on 
prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event.


Accuracy of linear regression
-
Root mean square error RMSE tells how much data is concentrated at the line 


Number of bins
-
The bin width (and thus number of categories or ranges) affects the ability of a 
histogram  Too large, and you will not get enough differentiation. Too small, and the data cannot be grouped.


Use of scatter plot 
-
Use a scatter plot when you have two variables that pair well together. 
If you have two variables that pair well together, plotting them on a 
scatter diagram is a great way to view their relationship and see if it's a positive or negative correlation.


What Is a Joint Probability
-
Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the 
likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time. 
Joint probability is the probability of event Y occurring at the same time that event X occurs.


confidence interval
-
statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of estimate computed from the 
statistics of the observed data. This gives a range of values for an unknown parameter


Difference between histogram and bar graph
-
Histograms are used to show distributions of variables while bar charts are used to compare variables. 
Histograms plot quantitative data with ranges of the data grouped into bins or intervals while bar charts plot categorical data.

Rank 
-
Relationship between two set of items


AutoCorrelation 
-
Autocorrelation is a mathematical representation of the degree of similarity between 
a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals. 
It's conceptually similar to the correlation between two different time series, but
autocorrelation uses the same time series twice: once in its original form and once lagged one or more time periods. 

time series data 
-
Time series data, also referred to as time-stamped data, is a sequence of data points indexed in time order. Time-stamped is data collected at different points in time. These data points typically consist of successive measurements made from the same source over a time interval and are used to track change over time.
