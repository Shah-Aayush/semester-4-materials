ADDRESSING MODES

1.	IMPLIED MODE
	operands are specified implicitly in the definition of the instruction 
	ex.:  CMA (complement accumulator)
	
2.  IMMEDIATE MODE
	Operand  is specified in the instruction itself.
	ex.: MOV R1, 05H
	
3.  REGISTER MODE
	Operands are in register that reside within CPU.
	ex.: MOV AX,BX
	
4.  REGISTER INDIRECT MODE
	instruction specifies a register in the CPU whose content give the address of the operand in memory
	ex.: MOV [R1],R2
	
5.  AUTOINCREMENT or AUTODECREMENT MODE
	similar to the register indirect mode expect that the  register is incremented or decremented after or before its value is used to access memory.
	
6.  DIRECT ADDRESS MODE
	the  effective address is equal to the address part of the instruction
	ex.: ADD 457
	
7.  INDIRECT ADDRESS MODE
	Effective address = address part of instruction + content of CPU register
	
8.  RELATIVE ADDRESSING MODE
	Effective address = address part of instruction + content of PC
	
9.  INDEXED ADDRESSING MODE
	Effective address = address part of instruction + content of index register
	
10. BASE REGISTER ADDRESSING MODE
	Effective address = address part of instruction + content of base register
